# Android ANT SDK v.C.B7 - 05 Jun 2023

This software development kit provides the resources needed to develop an Android application which uses ANT technology to communicate wirelessly between ANT enabled devices. It includes instructions, API and documentation, and reference sample applications. The PDF _Creating ANT Android Applications_ explains how to get started.

If you are trying to develop an application to connect to ANT+ devices on the ANT+ network, you must use the ANT+ Android SDK instead.

This SDK is available from:

* <http://www.thisisant.com/developer/resources/downloads/>
* <https://github.com/ant-wireless/ANT-Android-SDKs> (subscribe as a watcher to be notified of updates)

## Quick Start Guide

<i> Note: Refer to the "Creating ANT Android Applications" (.pdf) file for more detailed info </i>

1. Ensure ANT Radio Service (ARS) is installed on device
2. Reference ANTLib library in your application project
3. Refer to the Acquire Channels Sample to see how to:
    1. Bind to ARS
    2. Acquire channels
    3. Configure and open channels
    4. Send and receive data
    5. Release channels
