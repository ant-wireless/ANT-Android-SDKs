# ANT and ANT+ Android SDKs

The Android ANT and Android ANT+ SDKs enable developers to create unique applications that use ANT wireless communication technology to communicate between a wide array of devices over various network configurations. ANT is a proven ultra-low power wireless sensor network protocol operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and is an effective solution for personal and local area networks. ANT is available on many Android devices including most modern flagship phones from Samsung and Sony. Additionally, ANT can be used on other devices with USB-Host(USB OTG) support through the use of an ANT USB stick.

This SDK contains the required resources for developing ANT enabled applications on Android platforms:

* <b>ANT+ SDK (often referred to as the 'ANT+ Plugins')</b> enables Android developers to easily connect to ANT+ certified devices through a high level, intuitive API. The ANT+ SDK abstracts the connection and pairing process and the decoding and sending of data into easy to use functions and events.

* <b>ANT SDK (often referred to as the 'AntLib' or the 'ANT channels interface')</b> enables developers to communicate directly with the ANT protocol to create and connect to custom ANT networks with flexible and powerful communication capabilities.
